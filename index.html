                    <p>ABBA's story began in Stockholm, Sweden, in the early 1970s when two couples, Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog, as well as Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, came together through the Swedish music scene. They initially collaborated on various projects, but it wasn't until 1972 that they officially formed the group ABBA. The name "ABBA" is an acronym of the first letters of the members' names.</p>

                    <p>Their breakthrough came with their victory in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1974 with the song "Waterloo," which catapulted them to international fame. From there, ABBA went on to dominate the charts with numerous hits characterized by catchy melodies, rich harmonies, and a unique blend of pop and disco influences. Their music and distinct style have left an indelible mark on pop culture, making ABBA one of the most successful and enduring musical acts in history.</p>
